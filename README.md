# Drone Homecoming 
An innovative research project in the field of drones and in the field of AI.

Extrapolating missing sensors in drones.
Implementation of the popular drone's feature "Back to Operator" without the need for RF, VISION, or GPS sensors.

This project / research is divided into two parts:
1. Utilizing other, "internal" drone sensors to predict a drone's GPS signal. Using algorithms based on deep learning. And using flight simulator data.
2. Using the solution we developed in part 1, we implemented the "Back to the Operator" feature using deep reinforcement learning. A flight simulator also simulates the interaction between the agent (drone) and the environment.

In order to simulate a flight we use Microsoft AirSim, which is a popular flight simulator.
